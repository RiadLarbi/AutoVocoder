# PAcodec: Prosody-Aware Codec for Speech Synthesis

**PAcodec** (Prosody-Aware Codec) is an enhanced, F0-guided fork of the original AutoVocoder, designed to improve the naturalness, clarity, and prosody of synthesized speech. This repository implements a **Fundamental Frequency (F0)-Guided Parallel Architecture** combined with **attention-enhanced residual blocks** to produce high-fidelity and pitch-aware speech output. It is built upon the original AutoVocoder architecture and incorporates new methods for handling spectral components and prosodic features.

##  Overview
![architecture_overview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00da8497-7a43-4280-9b5e-ca757becbae8)
PAcodec enhances the AutoVocoder in the following key ways:

- **F0-Guided Parallel Encoding**:
  - Separates spectral processing into two parallel paths:
    - A general spectral encoder.
    - An F0-masked encoder focusing on frequency bands around the fundamental frequency.
- **CBAM-Enhanced Residual Blocks**:
  - Uses channel and spatial attention mechanisms to focus on the most relevant speech features.
- **Pitch-Aware Representation**:
  - Incorporates Gaussian masking based on F0 extracted via the pYIN algorithm for pitch-centric modeling.
- **Improved Decoder**:
  - Reconstructs phase and magnitude components via a unified decoder and synthesizes waveforms with inverse STFT in polar form.

##  Features

- **Spectral Input**: Phase, magnitude, and power spectrograms.
- **F0 Integration**: Gaussian masking on frequency bins around the estimated F0.
- **Dual Encoder Paths**: Main path + F0-masked path with fusion at the feature level.
- **CBAM Attention**: Enhances feature maps with spatial and channel-wise relevance.
- **Robust Reconstruction**: Decoding into polar spectrograms and waveform synthesis.
